    "Database is where we store our data/information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Type: SQL databases are primarily called Relational Databases (RDBMS); whereas NoSQL databases are primarily called non-relational or distributed databases\n",
    "\n",
    "Language: SQL databases use a structured query language (SQL) for defining and manipulating data, which is versatile and widely-used, especially for complex queries.\n",
    "NoSQL databases,on the other hand, have a dynamic schema for unstructured data and the syntax varies from database to database\n",
    "\n",
    "Scalability: SQL databases are vertically scalable, which means that you can increase the load on a single server by increasing things like RAM, CPU, or SSD.\n",
    "NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable, meaning you handle more traffic by sharding, or adding more servers in your NoSQL database\n",
    "\n",
    "Structure: SQL databases are table-based, making them a better option for applications that require multi-row transactions.\n",
    "NoSQL databases can be key-value pairs, document-based, graph databases, or wide-column stores\n",
    "\n",
    "Properties: SQL databases follow ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability)\n",
    "whereas the NoSQL database follows the Brewers CAP theorem (Consistency, Availability, and Partition tolerance)\n",
    "\n",
    "Support: Great support is available for all SQL databases from their vendors and a lot of independent consultants.\n",
    "For some NoSQL databases, you still have to rely on community support and only limited outside experts are available for setting up and deploying your large-scale NoSQL deploy\n",
