    "They might be based on data structures like documents. \n",
    "Non-relational databases are ideal for handling large volumes of complex and diverse data and are highly efficient in\n",

    "'''\n",
    "Document Model: MongoDB is a document-oriented database, which means that data is stored as documents,\n",
    "and documents are grouped in collections. The document model is more natural for developers to work with because\n",
    "documents are self-contained and can be treated as objects. This allows developers to focus on the data they need to store and process,\n",
    "rather than worrying about how to split the data across different rigid tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Flexible Schema: Documents in a single collection don’t necessarily need to have exactly the same set of fields.\n",
    "This flexibility allows developers to iterate faster and migrate data between different schemas without any downtime.\n",
    "However, if you want to lock down your schema at a certain point, you can do so by applying validation rules to your collections.\n",
    "\n",
    "BSON Format: Documents in MongoDB are stored in the BSON format, which is a binary-encoded JSON format.\n",
    "This allows for the storage of binary data, which is useful for storing images, videos, and other binary data.\n",
    "Even though BSON is a binary-encoded format, it’s easy to work with it using the MongoDB driver for your programming language.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sharding: Sharding is the process of splitting larger datasets across multiple distributed instances, or “shards”.\n",
    "When applied to particularly large datasets, sharding helps the database distribute and\n",
    "better execute what might otherwise be problematic and cumbersome queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Replication: MongoDB provides high availability with replica sets.\n",
    "A replica set consists of two or more copies of the data.\n",
    "Each replica set member may act in the role of primary or secondary replica at any time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Indexing: Indexes support the efficient execution of queries in MongoDB.\n",
    "Without indexes, MongoDB must perform a collection scan, i.e., scan every document in a collection,\n",
    "to select those documents that match the query statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Load Balancing: MongoDB uses sharding to provide horizontal scalability. This is done by distributing data across many servers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Support for Multiple Storage Engines: MongoDB supports multiple storage engines, such as WiredTiger and MMAPv.\n",
    "\n",
    "Aggregation Framework: MongoDB provides an aggregation framework to perform grouped operations on the data, like SQL’s GROUP BY.\n",
    "\n",
    "Text Search: MongoDB supports text search, making it easy to find documents that contain a specific word or phrase.\n",
